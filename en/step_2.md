## Draw a face

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">
In Scratch, characters and objects are called **sprites**, and they appear on the **Stage**. The picture used for a sprite is called a **costume**. 

Add a face to the **Ball** sprite to make it more interesting.
