## Add a Ball sprite

In Scratch, you add code to __sprites__ which are any characters and objects in your project. You're going to create a Ball sprite and turn it into a stress ball.

Open a new Scratch project.

**Online:** open a new online Scratch project at [rpf.io/scratch-new](http://rpf.io/scratch-new){:target="_blank"}.

**Offline:** open a new project in the offline editor.

If you need to download and install the Scratch offline editor, you can find it at [rpf.io/scratchoff](http://rpf.io/scratchoff){:target="_blank"}.

The Scratch environment which you will open looks like this:
