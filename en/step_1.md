## Introduction

Use Scratch to create a stress ball app that you can click to squash!

You will:
+ Turn a ball sprite into a stress ball by adding details in the Paint editor
+ Add `Looks`{:class="block3looks"} and `Sound`{:class="block3sound"} code blocks to squash your stress ball sprite when you click on it
+ Add a backdrop to the Stage to make your app more colourful

In Scratch, characters and objects are called **sprites**, and they appear on the **Stage**.

### Try it
<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 175px; flex-grow: 1">  
Click or tap on the stress ball to squash it and hear the sound that it makes.

What happens if you click on the stress ball a few times quickly?

Stress ball is the first project in the [Look after yourself](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/look-after-yourself) pathway. If you're not a complete Scratch beginner you could try one of the other projects.
